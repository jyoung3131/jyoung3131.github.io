## Requesting a Letter of Reference
I am happy to provide a reference letter if I have advised you for undergraduate research or if you have completed one semester of the VIP class, I teach, "Future Computing with the Rogues Gallery. This page lists requirements for requesting a reference letter. Please provide the following with your request via email:

* A weblink to the position for which you are applying.
* The deadline for the reference letter.
* An updated version of your resume or CV.
* Some detail on why you are applying to this position. This is especially important if it is not closely related to what you are working on. As an example, if you ask for a reference to a machine learning position it would be helpful to list other experience that you are basing your application on.
